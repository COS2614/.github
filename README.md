# COS2614 Organization

Welcome to the COS2614 organization on GitHub! This organization is aimed at university students studying "COS2614: Programming: Contemporary concepts" and is dedicated to helping students learn C++ and the Qt framework.

The purpose of this organization is to encourage student participation and facilitate learning by providing a platform where students can access various resources, including code examples, solutions to programming challenges, and discussion forums where they can seek and provide help. 

Most of the code examples provided in this organization are based on the book "An Introduction to Design Patterns in C++ with Qt, 2nd Edition" by Alan Ezust and Paul Ezust. We have attempted to port the code written for Qt4 to Qt6, so students can practice coding in a more recent version of Qt.

## First off
This is a work in progress (as of March 2023). Contributions to this organization will be made over time, so check back for updates.
If there is something in particular you would like help with, please see the *contact us* section below and get in touch :)

## How to use these repositories

These repositories contain various resources to help students learn C++ and the Qt framework. Here's a quick overview of what you can find in this repository:

- Code examples: These repositories contain code examples that cover various topics related to C++ and Qt programming. You can use these examples to practice coding and to get a better understanding of how C++ and Qt work.
- Programming challenges: We have included programming challenges in this repository to help you practice your programming skills. These challenges are designed to test your knowledge of C++ and Qt, and to help you apply the concepts you have learned in class.
- Discussions: We encourage students to participate in discussions on the discussion forums to ask and answer questions, share tips and best practices, and help each other learn.
